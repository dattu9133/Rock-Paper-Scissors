## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is an enhanced implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly select its move. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules of the game. Additionally, the score will be stored in the browser's `localStorage`, and players can reset the score if they wish.

### How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Choose your move by clicking on the corresponding emoji button (üëä for Rock, ‚úã for Paper, ‚úåÔ∏è for Scissors) or by pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard (R for Rock, P for Paper, S for Scissors).
4. The computer's move will be randomly generated.
5. The result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or it was a tie.
6. The score will be updated accordingly and stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
7. You can reset the score to zero by clicking the "Reset Score" button.
8. You can activate AutoPlay, which automatically plays the game every few seconds, by clicking the "AutoPlay" button. Click the button again to stop the AutoPlay.
